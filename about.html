      <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>Hi there! Thanks for checking out “All About Abroad: Barcelona.” My name is Raushan Melton, and I am a junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. I’m studying UX design, and for my SI 339 I’ve been tasked to create an accessible and fun website. You might be wondering: why have I decided to do a portfolio on the beautiful city of Barcelona? Well, this upcoming January, I will be studying abroad for 4 months in this beautiful city and I’m excited about the adventures that await. To explore more about the city prior to taking off, I’ve decided to make a guide of sights, food and museums I know I will be checking out and I hope others do too if they ever visit Barcelona themselves. I love to travel to other countries, and after speaking spanish for 6 years formally in school, I’ve decided it's time to finally explore the place I’ve only heard great things about: Barcelona. The lifestyle of Barcelona’s people has always intrigued me, and since beginning my own endeavors with the spanish culture I have been eager to see it all for myself. So, I encourage you to navigate through the different pages on this site to learn more about this amazing city! Feel free to reach out to me below using the contact form. </p>
