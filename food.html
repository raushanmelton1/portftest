    <p> Arguably one of the most popular dishes found in Barcelona, Spain is paella. Paella actually originated in Valencia, but has since become a staple in the Spanish diet. Paella is typically cooked in a large, flat dish over a long period of time. Depending on the type of paella, different proteins are the main elements complemented with vegetables and spices. These proteins could include seafood, which might have shrimp, mussels, and clams. Other paellas might entain sausage, chicken or other meat. Spices such as saffron make this dish delectable and unique to Spanish cuisine.</p>
